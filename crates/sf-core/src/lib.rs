//! # StitchFoundry core
//!
//! Geometry, the object-based embroidery design model, the stitch generation
//! engine and machine-level stitch patterns.
//!
//! * [`geom`] – points, transforms, splines, polygons with boolean/offset ops.
//! * [`model`] – [`Design`] made of editable [`EmbObject`]s (run, satin, fill,
//!   appliqué, lettering, raw stitches).
//! * [`engine`] – object → stitches, design → machine [`Pattern`].
//! * [`direction`] – inclination lines, turning strips, automatic stitch direction.
//! * [`brush`] – freehand stroke fitting, variable-width brush columns, preset shapes.
//! * [`attr`] – embroidery settings attached to objects of a host vector document.
//! * [`pattern`] – flat stitch/jump/trim/colour-change records.
//! * [`threads`], [`hoops`], [`fabrics`] – reference data.
//! * [`stats`] – stitch counts, thread usage, sewing time.
//! * [`io`] – native `.sfd` design files.
//! * [`ai`] – Design from Prompt: the request for stitchable art and reading the reply.
